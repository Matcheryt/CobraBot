# Setting Up
In order to open/use CobraBot, you'll need to have [.Net Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows) installed. Currently it runs using 1.1 version of .Net Core, but you can change it to a recent one, however, some changes to the code will need to be made for it to function properly.
